## FUNCTIONS in SQL

## Overview
In this paper I will give a brief overview of functions in SQL.

## SQL UDF
In SQL, a UDF is a user defined function. They are used to create custom functions outside of the standard function in SQL. You would create a user defined function if you were looking to do some analysis / augmentation and want to save the statement for ease of access. 

## Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions

There a three main types of functions. Scalar, Inline and Multi-Statement. Scalar returns a single value as an expression. Inline function returns a table similar to a view but has the added benefit of being able to set a parameter. Lastly, Multi-Statement Functions contain multiple statements and you have to specify the return variable. 

## Summary

In summary, UDFs are used to save statement for future analysis and augmentation of data. There are 3 main types of functions Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
